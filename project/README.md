GAMES INTERFACE

WHEN YOU START UP THE GAMES INTERFACE, IT WILL ASK YOU WHICH GAME YOU WANT TO PLAY. YOU CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN 4 GAMES: PONG, MARIO, TIC TAC TOE & SNAKE

YOU CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE INTERFACE USING YOUR KEYBOARD BY TYPING IN THE NAME OF THE GAME YOU WANT TO PLAY. WHEN YOU SELECT A GAME, AN EXTERNAL GAME PROMPT WILL OPEN WHERE YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME. PONG AND MARIO WILL PROMPT A LOVE SCREEN. TIC TAC TOE & SNAKE WILL PROMPT A NEW TERMINAL SINCE IT’S WRITTEN IN PYTHON.

IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ANOTHER GAME, YOU CAN PRESS “ESCAPE” AT ALL TIMES. THE INTERFACE WILL ASK YOU IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ANOTHER GAME. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ANOTHER GAME, YOU CAN ANSWER “YES” OR “Y”. OTHERWISE THE GAMES INTERFACE WILL CLOSE DOWN.
